Specifications of the delivered single‑file HTML template (save this for later)
1) Goal / Output
A single index.html file containing HTML + internal CSS + internal JS that recreates the mobile UI concept from your reference and works across desktop → tablet → mobile without separate files. UI reference

2) Responsive behavior (your main requirement)
The UI is built as a full‑page application layout:

Desktop/Laptop (web browsers):
The design covers the full viewport (full width + full height). Header and footer are full‑bleed across the page; content is centered and scales up smoothly.

Tablets:
The same design scales down automatically (no breakpoints required to “switch layouts”), keeping proportions.

Mobile phones:
The design further shrinks and fits all screen sizes, still showing the same structure and spacing.

This scaling is done primarily using CSS clamp(), so sizes smoothly adapt instead of jumping.

3) Layout structure (what’s on the screen)
Top header block: gray background with rounded bottom corners.
Menu button (top‑right): circular blue hamburger icon + “Menu” label.
Avatar circle: centered circle that overlaps header and content area.
Title: centered “Hospital Management System”.
Login card: rounded gray panel with:
“Admin Login” centered
two rows: Email : + pill input, Code : + pill input
red help text: “Any Issues trying to login ?”
pill button: “Secure Login”
Footer bar (bottom): gray full width with:
red “Report Emergency”
black “Copy Right Protected”
UI reference
4) Menu behavior (must-have interaction)
Menu button is clickable.
On click: a menu overlay appears above the content (not pushing content).
Clicking the menu button again hides it.
Clicking outside the menu (the dark backdrop) also hides it.
Pressing ESC hides it (desktop convenience).
5) Implementation details (so you don’t have to restate later)
Mobile-first sizing philosophy, but desktop fills full page.
Uses CSS variables in :root for quick edits:
colors (header, card, inputs, menu blue, danger red)
spacing/padding
radii (header + card)
shadows
